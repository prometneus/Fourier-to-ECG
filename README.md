# Fourier-to-ECG

This project is a research conducted in the third year of the university, aimed at exploring the possibilities of applying the Fourier transform to electrocardiography data for the classification of some cardiac diseases. Despite the fact that the study has mixed results, it has been shown that:
* Fourier decomposition of a high-quality digitized ECG might be a powerful tool utilized as a dimensionality reduction method.
* The spectra obtained using the Fourier transform do differ markedly in different diseases, which allows them to be used as features for machine and deep learning models in the task of disease classification.

However, the study also showed that this approach is highly demanding on the quality of the initial ECG data. To create a full-fledged medical assistant for a cardiologist, a large amount of such labeled data is required, which is undoubtedly a challenge. Moreover, such an approach, although possible, is not so effective due to computational difficulties.
